1)The body  of AddTwo(x)  seems to  be inlined into  the call  of main
  rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). Then why
  is the definition of AddTwo(x) still there all the way till the last
  pass (B-1.c.*.optimized)?
  Ans:It can't be discarded,because it may be called from the another translation unit.

 2)Is there any way to get rid of it?
 Ans:Add the static keyword to the prototype to signify that its linking is inernal only.
